# reaction-gallery
Example Flow.js project for storing & tagging images. Intended to be used as a private gallery for quickly sharing "reaction pics" in social media.

The project utilizes <a href="https://github.com/flowjs/ng-flow">ngFlow</a> & <a href="https://github.com/flowjs/flow-php-server">flow.js php server</a> for uploading images and <a href="https://github.com/leafo/scssphp">scssphp</a> for compiling scss into stylesheets.

The frontend is built with AngularJS and a bit of Bootstrap for styles.
